The Changeover Dinner was well attended by members and friends of the Club. The Club was very honoured to have the presence of the Hon. Gladys Berejiklian, Minister for Transport as the keynote speaker and to launch the Club’s new website.

In 2012/13 the Club sponsored Miss Emma Henke, a Year 12 student from Ravenswood School for Girls, Gordon in the Lions Youth of the Year Quest, She was the State finalist and we invited her back to speak on her experience in the competition at the Changeover dinner. We wish her all the best in her IB examination at the end of the year.

Past District Governor and Zone Chairman John Harrison inducted three new members for the Club. The three new members are Lion Alex Wu, Lion Michael Li and Lion Geri Liao. All Club members and other Lions friends warmly welcome them to join the Lions family.

The outgoing District Governor Greg Dunn conducted the Changeover Ceremony. In his acceptance speech as President of the Club, Lion David To expressed his wish to continue the good work in finding an ambassador for Lions youth of the Year Quest and to focus on expanding the Club’s membership. Club members and friends were entertained by the singing sensation, Mrs Regina Ma’s.
