Youth of The Year competition has been one of our lions club activity for the past 4 years. Students from Ravenswood and PLC Croydon have been supported this campaign for the past 4 years and has provided a number of good quality of students. This year, the YOTY competition winner is Miss Henrietta Chiu , she was represented by Ravenswood and accompanied by her father . It is amazing to see such a young talent to present in front of everyone and won this competition which is very well done to Henrietta.
