David extended a warm welcome to District Executive Lions Club members; the mayor, Pat Reilly; and Geoff Munday from Streetworks. The club's major beneficiary was Streetworks and Geoff Munday was there to accept a $5,000 cheque presented by David To with the help of Pat Reilly. Geoff gave a stirring account of work undertaken by Streetworks and explained the success of the program and of how the donation would assist in reaching more adolescents and young adults in need. Pat Reilly spoke of how the Willoughby City Council is planning the upgrade of the Youth Centre and other facilities to aid interaction among the young people in the community.
